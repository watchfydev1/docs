WatchFy’s secondary marketplace transforms collectible ownership into an open, tradable experience - giving users the ability to freely enter or exit.

Traditional collectibles lock capital for years, leaving investors dependent on auction cycles or private sales. WatchFy changes that by making watch shares liquid, transparent, and accessible 24/7.

Each share can be freely traded on WatchFy’s marketplace, powered by Solana’s fast, low-cost infrastructure. Users set their own prices, discover market value in real time, and trade instantly - all while maintaining verified on-chain ownership.

We’ll launch trading once we’ve fractionalized a few watches to ensure there’s meaningful liquidity for every user - because a market only works when everyone has room to move.
