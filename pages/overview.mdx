## The process

**1. Asset acquisition & verification** <br />
WatchFy sources high-end watches through trusted retail and secondary channels.
Each piece is inspected, authenticated, and securely held in insured custody.

**2. Buy shares: Fractionalization & share issuance** <br />
Every watch is fractionalized into shares, on-chain via tokens.
Users can buy and hold shares, each representing a proportional claim on the physical watch.

**3. Trade shares: Open trading** <br />
Shares can be listed on WatchFy’s secondary marketplace _(coming soon once liquidity is established)_, where users can buy or sell them freely.
All trades are settled transparently on-chain, ensuring 24/7 mobility in-and-out of a watch.

**4. Earn: Yield & returns** <br />
After holding the watch and allowing it to appreciate, WatchFy sells it in the physical watch market.
Proceeds from the sale are then distributed proportionally to all tokenholders.

## Why it matters

* **Access & inclusion** - open investment opportunities once reserved for insiders
* **Transparency & trust** - on-chain proof of ownership, provenance, and trade history
* **Liquidity in illiquids** - fractional shares transform collectible assets into active markets

WatchFy turns the world’s most coveted watches into investable assets - connecting passion, precision, and performance.
