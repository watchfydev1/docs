## Real returns

Users earn when WatchFy sells the physical watch in the real-world market, puts the proceeds on-chain, and distributes them proportionally to all tokenholders.

After fractionalization, WatchFy holds each timepiece for a strategic period of 3 to 24 months.
* On the shorter end, when we acquire a watch at a deep discount to the secondary market, we may exit early to deliver quick, outsized returns
* On the longer end, we may hold a watch to capture appreciation or benefit from a model’s discontinuation - when supply stops and scarcity drives value higher

When the timing is right, WatchFy sells the watch in the physical secondary market. Tokenholders then return to the WatchFy platform, burn their tokens, and receive USDC equal to their share of the total sale proceeds.

We currently charge no management or performance fees - meaning every dollar of profit earned from a sale flows directly back to users.

And this is just the beginning. In the future, WatchFy will launch yield protocols and lending markets, enabling users to earn yield or borrow against their holdings - expanding the ways RWAs can work for you.
