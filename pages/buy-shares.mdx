## Sourcing watches

We source most watches directly from the primary market, acquiring them at retail prices significantly below secondary market valuations. This allows WatchFy to capture appreciation from day one - buying at insider prices and later selling where real demand drives premiums.

Thanks to over a decade of industry relationships, WatchFy has access to exclusive allocations and newly released models that rarely reach the public market. Each timepiece is fully insured and securely stored in regulated vaults, ensuring complete peace of mind for users.

## Fractionalization

Every share on WatchFy is backed by a real, authenticated luxury watch. Once a watch is acquired, it’s fractionalized on-chain through the issuance of tokens on Solana, each representing a proportional ownership stake in the underlying asset.

Users can purchase these tokens on our platform using USDC through an Initial Watch Offering ("IWO"). Each IWO period lasts up to four weeks. If any shares remain unsold, WatchFy acquires them to ensure the watch is fully funded.

From there, users have two paths:

* **Hold and earn:** Retain tokens until the WatchFy team sells the physical watch in the secondary market after appreciation. Token holders can then redeem (burn) their tokens for USDC, receiving their proportional share of the profits
* **Trade early:** Sell tokens at any time on WatchFy’s secondary marketplace, realizing returns before the underlying watch is sold

## Example
A $10,000 Rolex Datejust is fractionalized into 1,000 tokens, each representing 0.1% ownership of the watch. Users can purchase these tokens either through the IWO or on WatchFy's secondary marketplace, and share directly in the upside when the watch appreciates and is sold.
